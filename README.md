![jasonsjukebox](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f06299a-a84b-4b54-beba-7c610073d15d)

A minecraft style jukebox, uses a RFID reader and card(the disk). Then plays music through a DFPlayer. This is powered by a esp32-c3

### My Experience

I had a great time making this project, the easiest part in my opinion was designing the case. I added wood texures to the squares to make the pattern easier to see. The hardest part was the Code as im still new to it but I believe everything is correct.
